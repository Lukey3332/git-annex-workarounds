This is a collection of some Workarounds around the limitations of git-annex. Like:
 -An option to include the gnupg home into the annex repo to allow shared encryption for gcrypt remotes
 -Using and Syncing git repos inside the annex repo (However be carefull that all files inside .git are present and unlocked)
 -Using annex-get and annex-drop to manage which files should be available in the local annex repo

Usage:

0. Put something like this into your .bashrc:
PATH=$PATH:~/Downloads/git-annex-workarounds/new-repo-template/.annex-workarounds/bin

1. Copy the new-repo-template to a desired location:
$ cp -a new-repo-template ~/annex

2. Initialize it:
$ cd ~/annex
$ .annex-workarounds/init-template.sh

3. (Optional) Specify your git repos inside .annex-workarounds/git-repos.conf
$ nano .annex-workarounds/git-repos.conf

4. Use it:
$ annex-sync --no-commit
$ annex-get <somefile>
$ annex-drop
$ annex find
